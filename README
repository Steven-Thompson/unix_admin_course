# General Comments
#   Stderr: All error messages are redirected to STDERR. I have included 
#   this at the front of the code to make it more readable.
#
#   All programs are called at the beginning of the script excluding
#   built in programs
#
#   All identified potenial error catchments exit with a non-zero exit
#   code
#
# Advanced Program Comments
#   Useage: ./advanced <switch> <arguments>
#   Example: ./advanced -p -b \*.txt txtfilesarehere -o
#
# Userman Program Comments
#   Useage: ./userman <argument> <argument>
#   Example: ./userman home ftp
#   Comments: Shellcheck reports a warning that not all variables are
#   being used in the program. However this is because the variables
#   are called on execution when the arguments are passed through.
#   I believe this is an efficent function to perform the required task
#
# Sysman Program Comments
#   Useage: ./sysman
#   Example: ./sysman
#   Comments: For the advanced and userman section of the menu system
#   I have added additional reads to collect the argument to be passed
#   to the script. All errors in this script are handles by the script
#   being called.
